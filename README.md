# Rails Docker Project

This is a Ruby on Rails application that can be run using Docker and Dev Containers.

## Development with Dev Container

This project supports development using VS Code Dev Containers, which provides a consistent development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Visual Studio Code with the Dev Containers extension

#### For Kali Linux/Debian users
If you encounter issues with PostgreSQL gem installation, you may need to install the PostgreSQL development libraries on your host system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libpq-dev postgresql-client
```

### Getting Started with Dev Container

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the Command Palette:
   - Press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
   - Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - Press Enter

4. VS Code will build the container and set up the development environment
5. Once the container is ready, open a terminal in VS Code and run:
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000
